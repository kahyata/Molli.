Molli is a dynamic quiz platform designed for tutors and learners to create, take, and manage exams tailored to individual learning paces. Tutors can **create, read, update, and delete (CRUD)** exams, which are stored in a database for easy access. Learners can test themselves with quizzes from past years or focus on specific topics, enhancing their understanding through active participation.

## Why Molli Matters

Molli empowers active learning by prioritizing **doing, questioning, and feedback** over passive memorization. Here’s why it stands out:

- **Customized Learning**: Tutors can craft quizzes and homework for specific students, perfect for personalized education or remediation.
- **Anti-Cheating Measures**: Tabs lock during quizzes—if a student switches tabs, the quiz closes, and marks are deducted for malpractice.
- **Engagement & Competition**: Students earn streaks and rank against peers globally, making learning fun and motivating.
- **Efficiency**: Tutors save time grading, and students access a growing library of filtered exams (e.g., by year or topic).

Molli is the go-to tool for educators and learners who want a flexible, interactive way to master material.
